# Git-md-diff
 A feature complete tool for managing documentations written in Markdown or MDX and generated via a specialized tool - e.g. Docusaurus. Written in JavaScript using NodeJS for backend and React for frontend. This repository contains code for my master's thesis.

## Quickstart

Make sure you have `docker` and `docker-compose` installed. Then run `docker-compose up` in the root folder of this repository and everything should start up automatically.

## Additional commands

You can also fix linting problems with:  npm run lint -- --fix

## Additional info
This repository uses forked markdown-diff version [Pryx/markdown-diff](https://github.com/Pryx/markdown-diff) which tries to solve some issues with the original version.
